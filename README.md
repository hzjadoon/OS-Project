## Introduction

Welcome to the **Operating Systems (OS) Project** repository! This project explores fundamental concepts of operating systems through practical implementations and experiments. It covers essential OS topics such as process management, memory management, file systems, and synchronization mechanisms.

## Features

- **Process Management**: Implementations of process creation, scheduling, and inter-process communication.
- **Memory Management**: Techniques for memory allocation, paging, and segmentation.
- **File Systems**: Basics of file creation, deletion, and manipulation.
- **Synchronization Mechanisms**: Solutions for process synchronization including mutexes and semaphores.
- **Practical Examples**: Real-world applications of OS concepts with detailed explanations and test cases.

## Getting Started

To start working with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hzjadoon/OS-Project.git
    cd OS-Project
    ```

2. **Compile the code**:
    Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed. Use the following command to compile the project:
    ```bash
    g++ -o os_project main.cpp
    ```

3. **Run the executable**:
    After compiling, run the project with:
    ```bash
    ./os_project
    ```

## Usage

Explore various OS concepts through practical implementations:

- **Process Management**: Test process scheduling and communication.
- **Memory Management**: Experiment with different memory allocation strategies.
- **File Systems**: Create and manage files, directories, and file operations.
- **Synchronization**: Implement and test synchronization mechanisms.

Refer to the [documentation](DOCUMENTATION.md) for detailed examples and instructions.
